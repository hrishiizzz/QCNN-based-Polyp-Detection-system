QCNN based Polyp Detection system
This repository implements a polyp detection system using Quantum Convolutional Neural Networks (QCNN). The model is designed to accurately identify polyps in endoscopic images, enhancing diagnostic capabilities in gastroenterology. It utilizes publicly available datasets for training and validation, and includes scripts for model training and evaluation. This project aims to contribute to improved early detection of colorectal cancer through advanced machine learning techniques.
